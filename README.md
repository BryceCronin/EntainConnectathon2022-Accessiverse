# EntainConnectathon2022-Accessiverse
My proof-of-concept game "Accessiverse" created for the 2022 Entain Connectathon.
Developed using AGK Studio and very poor coding practices in a few hours.

### Running on Desktop
 'Desktop App' --> 'Accessiverse.exe'.
 May require running as administrator.
### Running on Android
'Android App' --> 'AndroidAccessiverse.aab'.
Needs to be split into an APK file.
### Running on a Website
'HTML5 App' --> 'Accessiverse.html'.
Cannot be run locally.

## Note
Please note that online/multiplayer funcitonality is no longer present as it was extremely unreliable due to the short time frame in which I had to develop it.
I endeavour to rewrite Accessiverse with online connectivity after the 2022 Entain Connectathon has concluded.
